# Naughty or Nice

This is the frontend (html, css, and js) for
[naughty-or-nice](https://github.com/charlietanksley/naughty_or_nice).

It's built using Lineman.  It's so basic that there is no framework
here, just a handful of small utilities pulled together using
[Ender](http://ender.jit.su/).

# Contributing

I'd be shocked if anyone wanted to contribute to this, but here goes:

1. Install lineman: `npm install -g lineman`.
2. Within the project directory, `npm install`.
3. Do your thing.

If you need to interact with the ender build any, you need to

1. Install ender: `npm install -g ender`.
2. `ender --help` for details on what to do next.
